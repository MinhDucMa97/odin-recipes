    <ul>
      <li>15 oz. ricotta cheese (2 cups)</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese</li>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350°. In a deep 13"-by-9" ceramic, glass, or metal
        baking dish, spread 1 1/2 cups Bolognese, followed by 3 pasta sheets and
        3/4 cup béchamel. Sprinkle with about one-fifth of mozzarella and
        Parmesan. Repeat to make 5 layers, finishing with cheese.

        Bake lasagna 20 minutes, then increase oven temperature to 400°. Uncover
        and continue to bake until sides are bubbling and darkened and cheese
        starts to turn golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.

        Turn broiler to medium. Broil lasagna, watching closely, until top is
        toasted, about 1 minute.
